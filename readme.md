Define
======== 

A simple app that uses my own livesearch/autocomplete library to suggest words from a dictionary as you type, and fetch the definitions for a word that you submit via the Google Dictionary API (JSONP).
Livesearch uses a trie to get over 100000 words from files/words.json and immediately display all the words that start with what you typed in.
